Hi this is kunal AND i AM GETTING TRAINED ON USING THE GITHUB,

In the second stage of the training we are learning about staging the files as  well  as implementing the changes in the existing file.


This is another new information which I am adding to this file so that it will appear the files and folders of the GitHub repo.
